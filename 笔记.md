devdependencies

also installed on npm install on a directory that contains package.json, unless you pass the --production flag, or if the NODE_ENV=production environment variable is set

not installed on npm install "$package" on any other directory, unless you give it the --dev option.

Transitivity (mentioned by Ben Hutchison):

dependencies are installed transitively: if A requires B, and B requires C, then C gets installed, otherwise, B could not work, and neither would A.

devDependencies is not installed transitively. E.g. we don't need to test B to test A, so B's testing dependencies can be left out.

### 关于 context

createContext 创建 context

Context.provider 来作为组件，进行包裹

useContext 这个 hook

**useEffect**

useLayoutEffect

useEffect is a React Hook that lets you synchronize a component with an external system.

useEffect(setup, dependencies?)
Your setup function may also optionally return a cleanup function.

When your component is added to the DOM, React will run your setup function.

When your component is added to the DOM, React will run your setup function. After every re-render with changed dependencies, React will first run the cleanup function (if you provided it) with the old values, and then run your setup function with the new values. After your component is removed from the DOM, React will run your cleanup function.

// 在 NaN 和 +1 or -1 上判断不太一样
React will compare each dependency with its previous value using the Object.is comparison. If you omit this argument, your Effect will re-run after every re-render of the component.

When Strict Mode is on, React will run one extra development-only setup+cleanup cycle before the first real setup. This is a stress-test that ensures that your cleanup logic “mirrors” your setup logic and that it stops or undoes whatever the setup is doing. If this causes a problem, implement the cleanup function.

Effects only run on the client. They don’t run during server rendering.

Connecting to an external system

Your setup code runs when your component is added to the page (mounts).
After every re-render of your component where the dependencies have changed:
First, your cleanup code runs with the old props and state.
Then, your setup code runs with the new props and state.
Your cleanup code runs one final time after your component is removed from the page (unmounts).

方便去排查问题
Try to write every Effect as an independent process and think about a single setup/cleanup cycle at a time.

进行自定义钩子函数

实现圆形
borderRadius: '50%',

将功能进行抽离，得到相应的 hooks，隐藏具体实现细节，只体现功能

dialog 对话框元素

记得把相应的 update 函数传递进去

```
  useEffect(() => {
    let ignore = false;
    setBio(null);
    fetchBio(person).then(result => {
      if (!ignore) {
        setBio(result);
      }
    });
    return () => {
      ignore = true;
    };
  }, [person]);
```

用一个变量，实现中断效果

//防止出现竞态条件
note the ignore variable which is initialized to false, and is set to true during cleanup. This ensures your code doesn’t suffer from “race conditions”: network responses may arrive in a different order than you sent them.

// 缓存 强缓存和协商缓存
Writing data fetching directly in Effects gets repetitive and makes it difficult to add optimizations like caching and server rendering later. It’s easier to use a custom Hook—either your own or maintained by the community.

Effects don’t run on the server. This means that the initial server-rendered HTML will only include a loading state with no data. The client computer will have to download all JavaScript and render your app only to discover that now it needs to load the data. This is not very efficient.
Fetching directly in Effects makes it easy to create “network waterfalls”. You render the parent component, it fetches some data, renders the child components, and then they start fetching their data. If the network is not very fast, this is significantly slower than fetching all data in parallel.
Fetching directly in Effects usually means you don’t preload or cache data. For example, if the component unmounts and then mounts again, it would have to fetch the data again.
It’s not very ergonomic. There’s quite a bit of boilerplate code involved when writing fetch calls in a way that doesn’t suffer from bugs like race conditions.

Notice that you can’t “choose” the dependencies of your Effect. Every reactive value used by your Effect’s code must be declared as a dependency.

prove that it’s not reactive and won’t change on re-renders

If you specify the dependencies, your Effect runs after the initial render and after re-renders with changed dependencies.

If your Effect truly doesn’t use any reactive values, it will only run after the initial render.

主要区别在于在初始化渲染后，会不会 re-render

三种
不传依赖项
依赖项为空数组
依赖项不为空

函数和对象，可能在每次渲染指向不同的地址，会导致 effect 函数频繁 setup 和 cleanup

尽量将所用到的函数或对象声明到 effect 中
Reading the latest props and state from an Effect
更新状态时，使用 update function c=> c + 1 形式

As a last resort (if these methods didn’t help), wrap its creation with useMemo or useCallback (for functions).

```
Your cleanup logic should be “symmetrical” to the setup logic, and should stop or undo whatever setup did:

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, [serverUrl, roomId]);
```

/// 受控组件和非受控组件
A Controlled Component is one that takes its current value through props and notifies changes through callbacks like onChange. A parent component "controls" it by handling the callback and managing its own state and passing the new values as props to the controlled component. You could also call this a "dumb component".
通过 props 获取初始状态值，并通过调用相应的 callback 来更新状态

// 状态或属性由其自己内部管理，通过使用 ref 来获取
A Uncontrolled Component is one that stores its own state internally, and you query the DOM using a ref to find its current value when you need it. This is a bit more like traditional HTML.

For a controlled component the value is passed in through props. An uncontrolled component would use state to control the value itself internally. This is the key difference.

// Controlled:
<input type="text" value={value} onChange={handleChange} />

// Uncontrolled:
<input type="text" defaultValue="foo" ref={inputRef} />
// Use `inputRef.current.value` to read the current value of <input>

在大多数情况下，我们推荐使用 受控组件 来处理表单数据。在一个受控组件中，表单数据是由 React 组件来管理的。另一种替代方案是使用非受控组件，这时表单数据将交由 DOM 节点来处理。

要编写一个非受控组件，而不是为每个状态更新都编写数据处理函数，你可以 使用 ref 来从 DOM 节点中获取表单数据。

在 React 中，<input type="file" /> 始终是一个非受控组件，因为它的值只能由用户设置，而不能通过代码控制。

React automatically re-renders components that read some context if it changes.

Passing data deeply into the tree

嵌套组件，层级比较深
只需要位于上下文环境中就可以了

useContext() always looks for the closest provider above the component that calls it. It searches upwards and does not consider providers in the component from which you’re calling useContext().

Updating data passed via context
